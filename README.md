# KixKernel
This kernel project is an educational operating system kernel designed to run on x86 architecture in 32-bit protected mode. The primary goal of this kernel is to provide a foundational understanding of low-level programming and the inner workings of operating systems, including memory management, process scheduling, and hardware interaction.
